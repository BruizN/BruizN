### 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate developer from **Santiago, Chile**, currently finishing my degree in Sofware Engineering. Unlike the stereotype of "just making it work," I am obsessed with **Software Architecture, Best Practices, and Automated Testing**.

My goal is to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world enterprise standards. I treat every personal project as a production-grade product.

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** [BeGamer Components](https://github.com/BruizN/begamer-pc-components) - An e-commerce API built with strict engineering standards (C4 Model, ADRs, CI/CD).
* 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced Linux Administration & Cybersecurity.
* 🧠 **My Philosophy:** I believe in **"AI-Assisted Engineering"**. I use AI as a Copilot to accelerate development, but I apply my own rigorous engineering criteria to audit, correct, and architect the final solution.
